## Why Data Scientists needs Kubernetes?

Data scientists often use [`containerization`]() technologies like [`Docker`]() to package their code and dependencies in a portable and reproducible way. Kubernetes is a powerful tool that can help data scientists manage and orchestrate these containers in a production environment.

Some of the main reasons why a data scientist might use Kubernetes include:

Scalability: Kubernetes allows data scientists to easily scale their applications up or down, depending on the workload. This can be especially useful for handling large data sets or running complex [`machine learning`]() models.

Reliability: Kubernetes can automatically monitor the health of [`containers`]() and automatically replace them if they fail, which can help ensure that data science applications are always available.

Portability: Kubernetes allows data scientists to deploy their applications to different environments, such as on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment, without having to change the underlying code or dependencies.

Resources Management: Kubernetes allows to easily manage resources like CPU, memory, and storage for the containers, this can help to optimize the performance of the Data Science workload.

Overall, Kubernetes can help data scientists to manage the deployment and scaling of their containerized applications in a more efficient and reliable way.

## What is Kubernetes?

`Kubernetes` is an open-source platform that helps to manage and [`orchestrate`]() containerized workloads and services. It is a system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

In simple terms, Kubernetes is like a traffic controller for your containers. It makes sure that your containers are running as they should, and if one of them fails, it will automatically start a new one. It also allows you to easily scale your applications up or down, depending on your needs.

This platform can run on-premises or in the cloud, and it makes it easy for organizations to deploy, scale and manage containerized applications in a consistent and predictable way.
