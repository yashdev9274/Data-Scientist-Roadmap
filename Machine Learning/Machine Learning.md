## Python libraries

### Numpy

 NumPy is a well-known Python library for multi-dimensional array and matrix processing. NumPy is ideally suited for machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) projects since it can handle linear algebra, the Fourier transform, and more. Users may quickly change the matrix to enhance machine learning performance. In comparison to most other Python libraries, NumPy is quicker and simpler to use.

 ### Pandas

 Another Python package, Pandas, which is based on NumPy, is in charge of creating high-quality data sets for machine learning and training. It utilises one-dimensional (series) and two-dimensional data structures (DataFrame). Because of this, Pandas can be used in many different fields, including as finance, engineering, and statistics. The Pandas library moves quickly, complies with rules, and is adaptable, unlike the sluggish animals themselves.
